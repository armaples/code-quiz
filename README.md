# Coding Quiz

## Description
This project was intended to create a basic quiz on coding that would log the initials and scores of the player. The intention was that the highscores be saved even if the user were to leave the page (this is currently not functioning -- see the Known Issues section).

## Known Issues

- At the moment, the localStorage does not save on refresh; so the view highscores only works for the current session. Once the page is refreshed, the highscores are refreshed.
